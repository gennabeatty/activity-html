    <p>Our great-grandmothers didn’t need nutrition lessons—then again, they weren’t forced to wade through aisle after aisle of packaged foods touting outlandish health claims and confusing marketing jargon. Over the last few decades, we’ve forgotten what <em>“real food”</em> is—and we’re left desperately seeking foods that will truly nourish our bodies. We’re disillusioned with the <em>“conventional wisdom”</em> for good reason—it’s gotten us nowhere.</p>

    <p>Achieving optimal health without calorie-counting, diet foods, or feelings of deprivation has never been easier. <strong>Practical Paleo</strong> explains why avoiding both processed foods and foods marketed as <em>“healthy”</em>—like grains, legumes, and pasteurized dairy—will improve how you look and feel and lead to lasting weight loss. Even better—you may reduce or completely eliminate symptoms associated with common health disorders!</p>
